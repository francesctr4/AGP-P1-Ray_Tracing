# Advanced Graphics Programming: P1 - Ray Tracing

Statement
Implement a 3D ray tracer as explained in class. Only spheres and planes are
required for this assignment, but more complex shapes are welcome. For
instance, a height map could define a bumpy floor (of course, in this case, the
intersection could not be analytically computed, but a search over the ray
should be executed; feel free to ask if you feel motivated).
Features
The raycaster needs to have several features amongst the following:
● Selection of the nearest intersected object
● Camera movement / mouse interaction
● Local illumination (ambient, diffuse, specular)
● Hard shadows
● Reflections
● Refraction
● Distance fog
● Cloudy sky
● Floor / sphere textures (checkerboard, marble, wood, etc)
● Antialiasing
